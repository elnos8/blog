## Problem IV

Let $\triangle ABC$ be an acute triangle $(AB > AC)$ inscribed in the circle $(O)$ with center $O$ and radius $R$.
The altitudes $AD$, $BE$, $CF$ intersect at $H$.
Let $AK$ be a diameter of $(O)$, and let $AK$ intersect $EF$ at $N$.

**(a)** Prove that $BKNF$ is cyclic and that
$$
\angle AKD = \angle AHN.
$$

**(b)** The line through $C$ parallel to $AB$ meets $BE$ at $M$.
Let $Q = BC \cap HK$, and let $P = EF \cap QM$.
Prove that $\triangle BPC$ is right-angled.

**(c)** Assume $A$, $C$, and the circle $(O)$ are fixed, with $AC < R\sqrt{3}$.
Point $B$ moves on the major arc $AC$.
Find the position of $B$ that maximizes the sum of perimeters of
$\triangle AEF$, $\triangle BFD$, and $\triangle CED$.
