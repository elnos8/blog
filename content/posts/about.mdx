I build software for a living.  
But I spend a lot of time thinking about other things.

My name is elnos. I'm a software engineer, a father, and someone who often drifts back to old memories — classrooms, notebooks filled with math problems, the first lines of code I wrote, the books I once stayed up too late to finish.

I still love mathematics.  
I still enjoy competitive programming.  
But I also love quiet afternoons with a novel, flipping through old manga, or rereading stories that once meant something to a younger version of me.

Family means more to me than anything else.  
Much of what I build, learn, or struggle through is quietly tied to them. I hope one day my children might read these words and see how their father was thinking at this stage of life — still learning, still trying, still starting again.

I'm not here to teach. I'm not here to impress.  
Writing simply helps me slow down.

This blog is a place to collect small thoughts before they fade — about math, code, books, nostalgia, and the strange way life keeps asking us to grow.

Nothing too serious.  
Just notes from someone who cares deeply, thinks often, and loves his family very much.
